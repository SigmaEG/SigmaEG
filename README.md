## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile, I'm a Computer Programmer with experience in both Software and Game Development aspects of programming. I also have a peculiar interest in Cyber Security, which has been a career goal of mine for quite a while.

I'm a Computer Programmer who has been programming for almost a decade now. I have varied experiences with many languages such as the `C Family (C, C++, C#)`, `Rust`, `JavaScript`, `Java` and `Luau`. The languages I am most fluent in reside in the `C Family`, with the largest amount of experience being in `Luau`.

I've managed to create pieces of software for both the `Windows` and `Linux` platforms over the years, some of which are primarily just utility tools for myself. I started out programming with `Luau` on the `ROBLOX` platform, and I haven't regretted it since. To wit, `Luau`
is the language of which I am the most proficient in.
If you wish to view some of my creations, you can do so by heading over to my [Portfolio](https://sigma-portfolio.carrd.co/#work).

I'm familiar with the `WPF Framework` in `C#`, `wxWidgets` in `C++` and `FLTK` in `Rust`. I've also delved a little into the `Win32 API` and attempted to create Native Windows GUIs using it.

On ROBLOX, I am familiar with the `Knit Framework`, alongside its utilities such as `Component`, `Trove` (now I use `Janitor`), `Input`, `TableUtils`, `Signal`, `Promise` and `Timer`. I have also recently started working with `React-Lua`, whereby I have created a plugin that converts `ROBLOX` instances, and its descendants, into `React.createElement(...)` syntax - similar to the Codify plugin. I also have a small amount of experience with developing a Discord bot (`JavaScript`) to handle a Sith Order on `ROBLOX`, such as awarding tokens, keeping track of play time etc.

If you wish to get in contact with me, my primary method of communication is via Discord. My handle is `sigmaeg`.

Please don't contact me for general queries as my DMs are usually only open to friends or to people who wish to commission me.

Thanks for reading.
